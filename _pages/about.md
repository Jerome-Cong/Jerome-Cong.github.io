Hi, I'm currently a research engineer in the ETS lab of Tsinghua University with Prof. Xiaobo Qu. And I will start my PhD here from 2024 fall advised by Prof. Xiaobo Qu and Prof. Kai Wang. Previously, I received my Bachelor's degree of Engineering in 2020 from Beijing Institute of Technology and my Master's degree of Science in 2023 from TU Delft.

My main research interest lies in the decision-making and motion planning of autonomous robots, Reinforcement Learning, and Graph Neural Networks.

Academic service: reviewer of T-IV, T-SMC, T-CYBER, and COMMTR

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too.
